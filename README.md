# Office-Automation-using-ESP32
In order to automate common office duties, such as regulating the lighting, temperature, and security systems, a project called "Office Automation Using ESP32" involves connecting the ESP32 microcontroller with a variety of sensors and actuators. Office systems can be remotely controlled and monitored with the ESP32, which can be configured to connect to Wi-Fi networks and communicate with other devices. This study shows how IoT technology has the potential to increase workplace productivity and efficiency.
